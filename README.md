# Classifier-Performance-Across-Diverse-Datasets-Evaluating-and-Comparing-Machine-Learning-Models
In this project, we examine the performance of various classifiers on multiple datasets, including the Iris plant dataset, Breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset, Optical recognition of handwritten digits dataset, Wine recognition dataset, 20 newsgroups text (vectorized) dataset, and Labeled Faces in the Wild face recognition dataset. Each dataset presents its unique challenges, and the performance of the classifiers varies accordingly.

In summary, we conclude that:

For toy datasets, SVM with RBF kernel performs exceptionally well, especially with feature standardization.
Perceptron and Decision Tree classifiers do not always yield outstanding results but can still be viable options depending on the case.
In text and face recognition datasets, Logistic Regression emerges as the best classifier, with high accuracy and f1-score metrics and low mean squared error and hamming loss metrics.
In this project we highlight the importance of considering various classifiers and feature standardization techniques when working with different types of datasets, as the performance of the classifiers may vary significantly depending on the dataset at hand.
